## Workflow
### Agile Methodology
For this project I adopted an Agile methodology.  This is the first time I have used this on a solo project although I have used it as a group during the hackathons.  I feel this has helped me to:
- Organise and prioritise my workflow.  This has been essential due to the very limited timeframe we had to complete this project.
- Enabled me to adjust my expectations and still produce the required MVP

I created a site map and workflow diagram:

I used Github projects to convert my user stories into actionable tasks.  The acceptance criteria was very helpful to ensure all necessary tasks were completed.

### Models
In RecipMe I used the Django AllAuth User Model and created a custom Recipe Model.  This included the following fields:

|      Name            |     Type                   |     Key  |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------|
|      user            |     User Model             |     FK   |
|      title           |     CharField              |          |
|      slug            |     CharField              |          |
|      description     |     CharField              |          |
|      instructions    |     RichTextField          |          |
|      ingredients     |     RichTextField          |          |
|      freezable       |     boolean                |          | 
|      serving         |     CharField              |          |
|      image           |     ResizedImageField      |          |
|      image_alt       |     CharField              |          | 
|      Recipe_type     |     CharField  dropdown    |          |
|      Cooking_method  |     CharField  dropdown    |          |
|      posted_date     |     DateTimeField          |          |

I also added a many to many field called is_favourite to enable the favourite functionality.

### Walkthough of site including screenshots of every page

Future features not implemented at this time include:
- The ability on the full recipe page to toggle on/off dark mode and prevent your screen turning off, a feature I feel would be very useful when following a recipe
- Recipe sharing - To be able to share recipes with other users of the site or to email them to others
- Upload recipes to main site - The ability to request admin approval for a recipe to be added to the site wide collection
