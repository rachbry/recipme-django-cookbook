## Workflow
### Agile Methodology
For this project I adopted an Agile methodology.  This is the first time I have used this on a solo project although I have used it as a group during the hackathons.  I feel this has helped me to:
- Organise and prioritise my workflow.  This has been essential due to the very limited timeframe we had to complete this project.
- Enabled me to adjust my expectations and still produce the required MVP

I created a site map and workflow diagram:

I used Github projects to convert my user stories into actionable tasks.  The acceptance criteria was very helpful to ensure all necessary tasks were completed.

### Models
In RecipMe I used the Django AllAuth User Model and created a custom Recipe Model.  This included the following fields:

|      Name            |     Type                   |     Key  |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------|
|      user            |     User Model             |     FK   |
|      title           |     CharField              |          |
|      slug            |     CharField              |          |
|      description     |     CharField              |          |
|      instructions    |     RichTextField          |          |
|      ingredients     |     RichTextField          |          |
|      freezable       |     boolean                |          | 
|      serving         |     CharField              |          |
|      image           |     ResizedImageField      |          |
|      image_alt       |     CharField              |          | 
|      Recipe_type     |     CharField  dropdown    |          |
|      Cooking_method  |     CharField  dropdown    |          |
|      posted_date     |     DateTimeField          |          |

I also added a many to many field called is_favourite to enable the favourite functionality.


## Design
### Wireframes and Features
The site will be fully responsive and accessible on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

The homepage will feature a jumbotron image and call to action button.  Reasons why you should join will be listed here.

**All Users:**
- Are able to view admin added recipes
- Are able to use the search functionality

**Logged In Users:**
- Can add recipes
- Can view, edit and delete their own recipes
- Can add recipes to their favourites
  
They will have a personalised home page with all their recipes on it and will be able to view recipes they have favourited, both from their own and the site recipe collections.  Each recipe card will be a clickable link to the full recipe.  The same page layout will be used for the recipe collection, the users homepage and the favourite recipes page to maintain consistency and simplicity throughout.

**The Full Recipe Page:**
Will contain all the relevent information for each recipe.  Design will ensure all ingredients and instructions are available on one screen for desktop and tablet.

### Walkthough of site including screenshots of every page

### Future Features
Future features not implemented at this time include:
- The ability on the full recipe page to toggle on/off dark mode and prevent your screen turning off, a feature I feel would be very useful when following a recipe
- Recipe sharing - To be able to share recipes with other users of the site or to email them to others
- Upload recipes to main site - The ability to request admin approval for a recipe to be added to the site wide collection

To deploy the project to Heroku, I followed these steps:
#### **Creating Heroku App:**
+ Logged into Heroku.
+ Selected 'Create New App' from the dashboard.
+ Chose a unique app name.
+ Selected region based on the location.
+ Clicked 'Create App'.

#### **Connecting to GitHub:**
+ From the Heroku dashboard, navigated to the 'Deploy' tab.
+ Under 'Deployment Method', chose 'GitHub'.
+ Searched and selected the repository by name.
+ Clicked 'Connect'.

#### **Setting Environment Variables:**
+ Went to the 'Settings' tab.
+ Located 'Config Vars' and clicked 'Reveal Config Vars'.
+ Added the necessary variables.

#### **Manual Deployment:**
+ Went back to the 'Deploy' tab.
+ Located 'Manual deploy' at the bottom of the page.
+ Clicked 'Deploy Branch' and waited for the build to finish.

#### **Accessing the App:**
+ After the deployment was successful, I found and clicked 'Open app' at the top of the app dashboard.
