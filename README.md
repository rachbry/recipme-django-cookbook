## Workflow
### Agile Methodology
For this project I adopted an Agile methodology.  This is the first time I have used this on a solo project although I have used it as a group during the hackathons.  I feel this has helped me to:
- Organise and prioritise my workflow.  This has been essential due to the very limited timeframe we had to complete this project.
- Enabled me to adjust my expectations and still produce the required MVP

I created a site map and workflow diagram:

I used Github projects to convert my user stories into actionable tasks.  The acceptance criteria was very helpful to ensure all necessary tasks were completed.

### Models
In RecipMe I used the Django AllAuth User Model and created a custom Recipe Model.  This included the following fields:

|      Name            |     Type                   |     Key  |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------|
|      user            |     User Model             |     FK   |
|      title           |     CharField              |          |
|      slug            |     CharField              |          |
|      description     |     CharField              |          |
|      instructions    |     RichTextField          |          |
|      ingredients     |     RichTextField          |          |
|      freezable       |     boolean                |          | 
|      serving         |     CharField              |          |
|      image           |     ResizedImageField      |          |
|      image_alt       |     CharField              |          | 
|      Recipe_type     |     CharField  dropdown    |          |
|      Cooking_method  |     CharField  dropdown    |          |
|      posted_date     |     DateTimeField          |          |

I also added a many to many field called is_favourite to enable the favourite functionality.

## Design Choices
###  Colours

I used [coolors.co] (https://coolors.co/palette/253439-ff5757-545454-ffbd59-f5f4f3) to generate my colour palette:

![image](https://github.com/rachbry/recipme-django-cookbook/assets/73660517/027c781a-346b-4ed8-93ed-9a42815c0f0f)

I aimed for a clean and simple website design that keeps the focus on the content. Opting for a vibrant colour scheme, I wanted to strike a balance between minimalism and boldness. The light off-white background (#f5f4f3) keeps things simple and clean, while introducing splashes of colour add a touch of visual interest that contrasts against the neutral backdrop. This combination creates a modern look without being too over the top.

Coral and yellow form a complementary pairing, and their warmth complemented by cool grey tones, ensures a visually cohesive and balanced palette.  The neutral colours help maintain an overall sense of harmony.

The result is a carefully chosen color palette that enhances the design without overwhelming it, adding sophistication and vibrancy.

### Branding

### Typography

I created a logo on Canva using Josefin Sans, and used this for the headers and titles in my website for continuity of design.  While Josefin Sans has a geometric feel I paired this with Lato for a modern, clean appearance.  This pairing ensures readability, making text clear and easy to read. The fonts are versatile, suitable for various contexts like web and print designs. Despite their unique characteristics, they maintain consistency in proportions and weights, contributing to a cohesive and professional look. The combination strikes a balance, creating an aesthetically pleasing design that blends the vintage charm of Josefin Sans with the clean modernity of Lato.
